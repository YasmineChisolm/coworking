               As of 2019, 67% of New York’s population identifies as a person of color. And while there are hundreds of co-working spaces in NYC there was a lack of diversity, until Ethel's Club - the first  co-working and wellness space for people of color that recently opened up in Brooklyn.The 28 year old founder, Naj Austin says that what inspired her to create this space was the lack of diversity. She herself applied to trendy all women’s co-working space the wing, and for 2 years she kept her ear to the ground to see if someone would open a space and when they didn’t she did. The club, which opened its doors to its first 150 members last Monday, has been highly anticipated due to the lack of diversity and it’s strong social media presence and currently has a 4,300-person waitlist. The maps shown indicate the location of ethel's club, the % of people represented in NYC, and the areas of Brooklyn surrounding Ethel's Club.

                This map shows the percentage of people that idetify as POC in NYC. With over 67% of the population indentifiying, the lack of diversity in creative spaces is staggering, and beyond dissapointing. Spaces like Ethel's club which hosts 150 members and currently has a waiting list of over 4,300 shows that POC desire spaces like this, where they can feel included, accepted, and wanted.

        <p class="copy">Despite gentrification, Brooklyn is still a safe space for people of color to create. The first location of Ethel’s club is the heart of East Williamsburg. I had the privilege ivilege of touring the space and interviewing Andrea Hernandez who oversees the day to day operations of the club and speaking with Carolyn Adams who shared what this space means to her as a black woman.</p>

  <p class="copy">Ethel's club is the first space created for and by a person of color and what that means to the community is a safe space to be exactly who we are, and embrace all of who we are as we create, attend their events, and address our mental health.</p>
